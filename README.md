## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge consists of creating a functional clone of a social media platform.

- It should have a Login and Registration window for users to authenticate.
- On the main screen, users should be able to see user suggestions, follow them, and view recently posted images.
- Users should be able to explore other users' profiles and receive a notification when someone starts following them.

## My process

### Built with

- Python 3.10.6
- [Django 4.2.4](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) - Python library
- [Pillow 10.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) - Python Library


### What I learned


I have learned how to create forms, connect the backend to the SQLite database, and gained knowledge about building more scalable Django projects. Additionally, I've grasped the way front-end and back-end are interconnected.
